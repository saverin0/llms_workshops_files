# LLMs Workshops Files

A collection of Jupyter notebooks for hands-on workshops on Large Language Models (LLMs), Transformers, and Natural Language Processing.

## üìö Workshop Contents

This repository contains the following workshop materials:

### Getting Started
- **[Environment Setup and Introduction](oxford_llm_workshop_Env_setup_and_intro_.ipynb)** - Initial setup and introduction to the workshop series

### Core Workshops

1. **[Introduction to Transformers](oxford_llms_workshop_1_Intro_to_transformers.ipynb)** - Fundamental concepts and architecture of transformer models

2. **[Topic Modelling with Transformers](oxford_llms_workshop_2_Topic_modelling_with_transformers.ipynb)** - Using transformers for topic extraction and analysis

3. **[Fine-tuning Pretrained Models](oxford_llm_workshop_3_Fine_tune_pretrained_model.ipynb)** - Techniques for adapting pretrained models to specific tasks

4. **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning](oxford_llm_workshop_4_Parameter_efficient_fine_tuning.ipynb)** - Advanced methods like LoRA and adapters for efficient fine-tuning

5. **[Transformers Interpretability](oxford_llm_workshop_5_Transformers_interpretability.ipynb)** - Understanding and visualizing what transformers learn

6. **[Sentiment Analysis with Classic NLP](oxford_llm_workshop_6_Sentiment_analysis_with_classic_NLP.ipynb)** - Comparing traditional NLP approaches with modern methods

7. **[LLMs Alignment with RLHF](oxford_llm_workshop_8_LLMs_alignment_with_RLHF.ipynb)** - Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for model alignment

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- GPU access recommended for larger models

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/saverin0/llms_workshops_files.git
cd llms_workshops_files

# Install required packages (refer to individual notebooks for specific requirements)
pip install transformers torch torchvision datasets accelerate
```

### Usage
Open any notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Start with the environment setup notebook to ensure your development environment is properly configured.

## üìñ Learning Path

For the best learning experience, we recommend following the workshops in order:
1. Start with the **Environment Setup** notebook
2. Progress through **Introduction to Transformers**
3. Explore specific applications and advanced topics
4. Complete with **RLHF and Alignment** for production considerations
